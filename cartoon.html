		<p><strong>Dragon Tales</strong> is a Canadian–American animated fantasy adventure children's television series created by Jim Coane and Ron Rodecker, and developed by Coane, Wesley Eure, Jeffrey Scott, Cliff Ruby and Elana Lesser. The story focuses on the adventures of two ordinary kids, Emmy and Max, and their dragon friends Ord, Cassie, Zak, Wheezie, and Quetzal. The series began broadcasting on PBS on their PBS Kids block on September 6, 1999, with its final episode airing on November 25, 2005. Following the series finale, reruns remained on the block as well as on a channel related to it named PBS Kids Sprout (renamed Universal Kids) until August 31, 2010. Yearim Productions was responsible for the animation for all seasons (Sunwoo Entertainment and Wang Film Productions only did animation for season 1), with the exception of Koko Enterprises, which recorded the show, and The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, The U.S. Department of Education, Kellogg's, and greeting card manufacturer,<em>American Greetings</em> were responsible for the funding.</p>
		<h2><li>DEXTER'S LABORATORY</li></h2>
